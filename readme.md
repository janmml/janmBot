janmBot is a custom Discord Bot based on [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).

The bot itself is currently limited to just [our Discord server](https://janm.ml/discord), but feel free to host [your own bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications) based on this code.
Note that the bot isn't really made to work on multiple servers at once, so if you want it on more than one server at a time (and without changing some config files), you'd have to modify it yourself. This might change in the future (you can help with that, too).
